## Description

  Fullstack MVC application made for VVH Financial.
  
  I used bcrypt to hash passwords, session middleware to handle employee logins, and I also authguarded crud operations to secure sensitive data. Database protection was done by using Sequelize to perform ORM queries to the mysql database. 

  Views were made possible with the Handlebars template engine. Within Handlebars, partials were used to modularize repeating code. Inserted custom helpers to format dates and word pluralization.
